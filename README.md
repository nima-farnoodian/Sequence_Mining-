# Spade and F2-spade Sequence Mining Algorithms.

# Abstract:

In this project, for the Sequence Mining task, we were asked to implement either Spade or PrefixSpan Algorithm, and adapt them for the following tasks: Top-k Frequent Sequence Mining, Top-k Supervised Sequence Mining with Wracc scoring function, and Top-k Supervised Closed Sequence mining with respect to Wracc and Absolute Wracc as well as Information Gain scoring function. In total, this project revolves around five sequence miners and the evaluation of their extracted patterns. To this end, we implemented the Spade algorithm and one of its variations called f2-Spade algorithm to overcome the aforesaid tasks. Moreover, as the second goal of this project was to compare the patterns detected using the said tasks, we compared the detected sequence sets (e.g, how many sequences they share) and analyzed the performance of detected patterns in the supervised prediction task by training classifiers. Indeed, we tried to figure out how well the patterns could lead to accurate supervised prediction. It is remarkable that you can find our source codes and all our experiments here on this github repository.
